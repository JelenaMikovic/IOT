Raspberry Pi Smart Home System

- Overview:

This project implements a smart home system using Raspberry Pi devices, integrating a variety of sensors and actuators. The system provides real-time data monitoring, user-controlled automation, and extensive configurability.

- Key Features:

Script on three PI-s for configuration, sensor output, and console-controlled actuators.
Expanded with MQTT protocol, InfluxDB integration, and Grafana visualization.
Web application for user interface and data display.
Logic-based on sensor inputs, including ALARM states, temperature/humidity displays, and alarm clock settings.

- Components:

Sensors: Door, Motion, Ultrasonic, PIR, DHT, Gyro, Infrared.
Actuators: LED diodes, Buzzer, LCD, 7 Segment Display, RGB Bulb.
Functionality:
The project simulates and controls various aspects of a smart home environment, addressing security, environmental monitoring, and user interaction. The web application offers an intuitive interface, while sensor inputs trigger logic-based responses, creating a versatile and practical smart home solution.

- Technologies used:

Comprehensive sensor integration.
MQTT protocol for efficient data transfer.
InfluxDB for data storage.
Grafana for real-time data visualization.
User-friendly web interface for control and monitoring.
